It’s not exhaustive, but a good representation of what I do. If you're here, that probably means you've already seen my CV – if not, you can find that [here]().Please excuse any dead links, occasionally clients press the big red ‘reset’ button on their websites. Examples of product copy provided on request. I’ve included references to some of my print-only articles, but as I can’t link to them you’ll just have to take my word for their existence.

Strong candidate for the most fun I've had while being paid. Responsibilities included: creating the international Rapha Rides video brief; identifying the talent and concept for the six America shoots; leading prelimary interviews; art direction; leading the edit process between the director and brand-side creatives; a lot of driving. Los Angeles is linked above, and here's [New York](https://vimeo.com/221714081), [Seattle](https://vimeo.com/226391195), [Boulder](https://vimeo.com/215321383), [San Francisco](https://vimeo.com/215821947), and [Chicago](https://vimeo.com/229344370).

### Theatres of Cross, Rapha

I accompanied photographer Ben Ingham to France and Belgium, where we visited some of cyclocross's most storied and celebrated courses. The resulting exhibiton was shown at Rapha Clubhouses around the world.
